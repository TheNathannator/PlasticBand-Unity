# PlasticBand-Unity

A package for the [Unity InputSystem](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) package that provides mappings and classes for Rock Band and Guitar Hero peripherals.

## WIP

This package is a work-in-progress. Contributions are welcome!

Initial support for non-HID devices will likely be Windows only. Mac support will require contribution, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One support on Mac most likely cannot happen until a new driver for those is created, and assuming it supports getting capabilities or otherwise distinguishing between device types.
