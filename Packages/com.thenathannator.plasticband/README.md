## Usage

After installation, this package integrates and operates on its own. No manual initialization is required.

Device layouts from this package are used just like the built-in ones. You can use them in input actions, poll them manually through the provided static `current` and `all` properties on each layout, receive low-level `InputEventPtr`s through `InputState.onChange`, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Usage of `InputSystem.onEvent` for low-level state handling is *not* recommended, as many layouts in this package have their own manual state handling requirements (see [`IInputStateCallbackReceiver`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.LowLevel.IInputStateCallbackReceiver.html)) which will be bypassed if you use it. Use `InputState.onChange` or `IInputStateChangeMonitor`s instead. I've done my best to keep compatibility where I can, but certain spots are just inherently incompatible, and there's not much I can do.
>
> In addition, some special handling will be needed for `InputSystem.onDeviceChange` with regards to the variant device system that this package uses for certain devices. Any devices being `InputDeviceChange.Added` where `device.enabled` is false must be ignored, as these are the container devices used to enable variance. An example of this is provided in the [DeviceConnectionHandler sample](Samples~/DeviceConnectionHandler/DeviceConnectionHandler.cs).

This package has no dependencies, however I highly recommend installing the [HIDrogen](https://github.com/TheNathannator/HIDrogen) package in addition to this one, as it provides proper HID device support on Linux, and Xbox One controller support on Windows.

### Notes

- **Unity 2022.2 currently has issues with Xbox 360 controllers on Windows, and only the standard gamepad controllers will be picked up.** The only workarounds currently are to downgrade Unity or write your own XInput backend for the input system.
- Pre-compiling the layouts from this package is not currently possible without breaking things. A large number of them have to determine or construct things at runtime, and pre-compilation circumvents the mechanisms that allow these layouts to determine things in the first place.
  - At some point I could consider looking into workarounds for this (e.g. initializing everything in an `OnAdded` override), but for the time being it's not a priority. (PRs welcome if you can get it worked out!)
- Xbox 360/One controllers will only work properly on Windows currently. Mac and Linux require custom drivers or support through raw USB handling.
- Xbox One support on Windows requires the [HIDrogen](https://github.com/TheNathannator/HIDrogen) package to be installed alongside this one. No errors will occur without it, but they will not be detected by the input system otherwise.

### Configuration

Some configuration is available through compile defines:

- `PLASTICBAND_VERBOSE_LOGGING`: Enables some potentially repetitive logging to help debug issues with devices.
- `PLASTICBAND_DEBUG_CONTROLS`: Enables verbose logging for custom control types to help debug issues with devices.
  - Independent from verbose logging, since this is strictly meant for active development and debugging.
